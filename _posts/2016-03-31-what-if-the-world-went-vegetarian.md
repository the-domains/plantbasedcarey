Science! It's a process, a way of thinking about what we observe.

After watching the video, you might wonder what is "hard" about being vegetarian. My perspective is that being vegetarian, vegan, or totally plant based is not hard, but the transition feels hard because over the years of your life you have established so many patterns and habits that need to be unlearned. 

Starting off, your kitchen has been stocked over time with what you eat and cook with, much of which is not in your current diet. Think of moving into a new house in a country where all your familiar brands are not available. You have to buy every single thing in your kitchen, and you don't recognize the brands on the shelf. 

For example, when you shop for peanut butter today, you know what aisle it is in, which side and how far down. You don't even consider the dozen(s) of options, you just buy "yours." Now move to that new country. Let's assume they speak your language and you can read the labels. You still have a lot of work to do the first time you buy peanut butter for your new pantry. The second time you might still have to look for the section in the store, but by the third time, you walk right to it and toss one in your cart. 

I remember my first trip to the supermarket after adopting a plant based diet. I had to read every label, search for things I never bought (tofu) and determine what to do with some of the vegetables I never paid attention to before. It was hard. But the BEING isn't hard, the changing is. But it's fun too. 

Shopping and cooking is actually a lot easier now. I only need to visit four or five aisles in the whole store. I keep a container of cooked brown rice in the fridge and a couple containers with different beans already cooked up. Some pasta maybe. A jar of salsa, some self-made salad dressings and of course the veggies. Done. Toss together what I feel like eating and job done. 

Or I can get fancy and cook up a recipe. Whatever suits the time and place. 

Things seem to last longer in the fridge. And the pans are easier to clean. A lot of my cooking is done in an automatic electric pressure cooker. Best purchase I've made.
