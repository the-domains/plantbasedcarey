Click on the photo above to jump to an album of food I have made and/or eaten. When something looks yummy I just take a photo, partially to remember what to make in the future, and partly to add to the album to send people who ask "What do you eat?" 

I have gotten to the point where when an ad comes on the TV for a burger joint I'm thinking "Mmmm... look at that nice tomato and onion!" Seriously! It is to that point. Veggies just look yummy to me. They are my food.
