Click on the link above to jump to an album of food I have made and/or eaten. When something looks yummy I take a photo, partially to remember what to have in the future, and partly to add to the album to send people who ask "What do you eat?" or "Sounds boring."

I have gotten to the point where when an ad comes on the TV for a burger joint I'm thinking "Mmmm... look at that nice tomato and onion!" Seriously! It is to that point. Veggies just look yummy to me. They are my food.

Think of how much of the flavor of what you eat comes from the condiments and sauces involved. Use the same or similar sauces, just put it on veggies!
